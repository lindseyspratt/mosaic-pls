    In the 2 player game the winner is the first player to get 100 points or more at the end of two of your 'transform' turns in a row.
</p>
    <p>
You get points for regions of your color:
a region spans 2 or more tiles and the score for a region is the square of the number of tiles spanned by that region.
</p>
    <div class="example">
        Panel 1.1 shows a player 2 blue region that spans two tiles for a score of four points.
        The player 1 green areas do not span any tiles and so do not score any points.
        Panel 1.2 shows a player 1 green region that spans six tiles for a score of 36 points and a player 2 blue region that spans two tiles for a score of four points.
    </div>
    <canvas id="region_spans" width="800px" height="200px"></canvas>
<p>
    There are two phases of game play: <i>build</i> and <i>transform</i>.
    In the build phase the players build the board.
</p>
    <div class="example">
        Panels 2.1 through 2.3 show the first three steps in building the board for a two-player game.
   </div>
    <canvas id="build" width="800px" height="170px"></canvas>
<p>
    In the transform phase the players take turns transforming the board.
</p>
    <div class="example">
        Panels 3.1 through 3.3 show the three steps in transforming the board for a two-player.
    </div>
    <canvas id="transform" width="800px" height="200px"></canvas>
    <div class="example">
        In panel 3.1 player two has selected an adjacent pair of tile sides to transform, as indicated by the pale blue diamond.
        (An adjacent pair of tile sides is called an 'edge'.)
        To be transformed the selected sides must not be the transforming player's color.
        After the transformation these sides will have been changed to the transforming player's color and the other sides of those tiles will be as they
        were at the start.
        <br><br>
        In panel 3.2 the selected pair of tiles has been moved to player two's 'hand' to be placed in the board later.
        Also the tiles that may be used to replace these removed tiles have been marked with pale blue circles.
        <br><br>
        In panel 3.3 the replacement tiles have been moved to complete the transformation of the originally selected edge.
    </div>

    <ul>
    <li>
        Build:
    In the build phase players take turns placing tiles from their hands into the board until all tiles have been placed.
        <ul>
            <li>Color constraint: Adjacent tile edge colors must match.</li>
            <li>Shape constraint 1: A tile cannot be placed in the board such that there is a single-tile-sized space with another tile on the other side of that space.
                <div class="example">
                    Panel 4.1 shows an invalidly shaped board: the one-tile wide, two-sided gap, or hole, is not allowed in a valid board.
                    Panel 4.3 shows a validly shaped board: the gap is two tiles wide which is allowed.
                </div>
                <canvas id="shape_1" width="800px" height="200px"></canvas>
            </li>
            <li>Shape constraint 2:
    The first tile placed may be any tile in the first player's hand.
    The second tile placed must be placed orthogonally next to the first tile.
                After the first two tile plays, a tile must be placed with at least two neighbors at least one of which is orthogonal.</li>
    <li>Recency constraint: The active player may place any tile with a in their hand that satisfies the color and shape constraints into the board.
    If the selected hand tile can be placed next to the tile most recently added to the board
        (without violating the color and shape constraints) then it must be so placed.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        <div class="example">
            Panels 5.1 through 5.5 show the plays made to place the first three tiles on the board.
        </div>
        <canvas id="build_detail_a" width="800px" height="170px"></canvas>
        <div class="example">
            In panel 5.1 player one has selected a tile in their hand by clicking on the tile indicated by the pale green plus sign.
            This is the first tile to be placed in the board so any tile may be used.
            The location available for this tile is indicated by the pale green solid square.
            When player one clicks on the pale green solid square then the hand tile is moved to the board.
            <br><br>
            Panel 5.2 shows the game state after player one completes moving a tile to the board and player two has clicked on the tile with the pale blue plus sign.
            The possible locations where the selected tile may be placed on the board are indicated by the pale blue empty squares and the pale blue solid square.
            The solid square location is immediately available as a location to which the selected tile may be moved.
            Each empty square location requires the selected tile to be rotated one, two, or three times before being in the appropriate orientation for that location.
            Player two clicks on the the solid square location to move the selected tile to that location.
            <br><br>
            Panel 5.3 shows the game state after player two has moved a tile to the board and player one has selected a hand tile as indicated by the pale green plus sign.
            According to the 'Recency Constraint', if the selected tile can be placed next to the previously placed tile then it must be.
            In this case the selected can be so placed and the valid locations are indicated by pale green empty squares.
        </div>
        <canvas id="build_detail_b" width="800px" height="170px"></canvas>
        <div class="example">
            Panel 5.4 shows the game state after player one has clicked a second time on the selected tile in their hand
            (i.e. the one with the pale green plus sign).
            This click rotated the selected tile 90 degrees clockwise and changed a location to being valid as indicated by the pale green solid square.
            <br><br>
            Panel 5.5 shows the game state after player one has clicked on the valid location, moving a tile from their hand to the board.
        </div>
        <li>
    <p>Transform:
    A transform turn starts with a player choosing an orthogonally adjacent pair of tiles to be transformed where the adjacent color is *not* that player's color.
    These two tiles are removed to that player's hand.
    These two tiles must be replaced by two other tiles from the board that are identical except that the adjacent colors are changed to the player's color.
    The removal of one or both of these replacement tiles from the board may leave behind a hole, a violation of shape constraint 1.
    The player rebuilds the board, placing their hand tiles back into the board.
    </p>
    <p>Holes and mismatches:
    If there are any holes then the hand tiles must be used to fill those holes.
    Once there are no holes the hand tile(s) may be placed in any location that honors the color and shape constraints.
    If a hand tile can be used to fill a hole such that it honors the color constraint then it must do so.
    Having filled any holes with no color mismatches (if possible), then if a hand tile can be used to fill a remaining hole with only one mismatched side then it must do so.
    In general if all holes that could be filled with zero to N mismatches have been filled, then if there is a tile that fills a hole with N+1 mismatches then it must do so.
    </p>
            <p>
                Orphaned tiles: a tile is orphaned if after all plays have been made that tile has less than two adjacent tiles.
            </p>
    <p>
    When the transforming player has emptied their hand then their transform turn is done.
    If there are any mismatched orthogonally adjacent tiles in the board (as a result of replacements), then these mismatches must be resolved by the next player.
    The mismatched tiles, those adjacent to the replacing tiles, are removed from the board to the resolving player's hand.
        Also, any orphaned tiles are removed from the board and added to the resolving player's hand.
    Each mismatched tile must be replaced by a tile that is identical except the side orthogonally adjacent to the forcing tile - this side color must be changed to match the forcing tile.
    There may be multiple forcing tiles next to the same mismatched tile.
    The new replacing tile must match all of these forcing tiles.
    If the forcing tiles around a single location are more than two colors, then the replacing tile for that hole must minimize the color mismatches it forces.
    </p>
            <p>
        After all forced plays any remaining hand tiles are added to the board.
        This ends the resolving player's turn.
        If there are mismatched tiles or orphaned tiles then the next player becomes the resolving player.
    </p>
            <div class="example">
                Panels 6.1 to 6.8 show a transformation of an edge started by player one followed by a mismatch resolution by player two.
            </div>
            <canvas id="transform_detail_a" width="800px" height="200px"></canvas>
            <div class="example">
                Panel 6.1 shows player one having selected an edge as indicated by the pale green lozenge.
                <br><br>
                Panel 6.2 shows the tiles to-be-replaced in the player one's hand, four board tiles marked with pale green circles as replacements for the
                removed tiles, and one of these tiles also marked with a pale green plus sign as having been selected by player one.
                <br><br>
                Panel 6.3 shows a replacement having been made which left a three-sided hole.
                There is a location indicated in pale green solid square as the target
                for a second replacement.
                The one valid replacing tile is indicated by a pale green circle and that tile is selected by player one as
                indicated by the pale green plus sign.
            </div>
            <canvas id="transform_detail_b" width="800px" height="200px"></canvas>
            <div class="example">
                Panel 6.4 shows a target location in the hole in the board using a pale green solid square.
                The one replacement for that hole in player one's hand is indicated by the pale green circle.
                That replacement is selected by player one as indicated by the pale green plus sign.
                <br><br>
                Panel 6.5 shows the mismatched tile side using a pale blue triangle.
                This mismatch was caused by placing a hand tile in the hole.
                A pale green solid square indicates a three-sided hole which must be filled from player one's hand.
                The tile in player one's hand has a pale green circle indicating that it is a valid candidate for replacing
                the indicated location and a pale green plus sign showing it has been selected by player one.
                <br><br>
                Panel 6.6 shows the location where the mismatched tile was using a pale blue solid square.
                The mismatched tile has been moved to player two's hand.
                The only valid replacement for the mismatched tile is indicated with a pale blue circle.
                This tile has been selected by player two as indicated by the pale blue plus sign.
            </div>
            <canvas id="transform_detail_c" width="800px" height="200px"></canvas>
            <div class="example">
                Panel 6.7 shows the board after the completed replacement of the mismatched tile.
                Player two has selected the tile in their hand as shown by the pale blue plus sign.
                The possible locations for the selected tile are shown by the pale blue squares.
                The solid squares are selectable.
                The empty squares can be made selectable by rotating the selected hand tile.
                <br><br>
                Panel 6.8 shows the board after player two has placed their hand tile in the board (the sole tile
                on the top row).
                This completes the transformation round started by player one in panel 6.1.
                The score has changed in player two's favor.
                For panel 6.1 the game score is 40 points for player one and 33 points for player two.
                For panel 6.8 the game score is 40 points for player one and 49 points for player two.
