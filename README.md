# mosaic-pls
Mosaic game implemented using ProscriptLS

The game is documented in src/doc.html, which is linked from index.html and src/mosaic.html.

This implementation demonstrates use of Canvas 2D elements and user interactions all handled through Prolog.
Also there is a 'database' facility (implemented in Prolog) to handle game state and support undo and redo.
